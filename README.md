# Transfer-Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where knowledge gained from training a model on one task is leveraged to improve the performance of a model on a different, but related, task. In transfer learning, a pre-trained model, often trained on a large dataset, is fine-tuned or used as a feature extractor for a new task or dataset. This approach is especially useful when you have a limited amount of data for the target task.


## The general process of transfer learning involves the following steps:

**1. Choose a Pre-trained Model:**
 Select a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large and relevant dataset. The choice of model depends on the nature of the problem you're trying to solve.

**2. Modify the Model:** Depending on the target task, you might modify the pre-trained model by adding new layers, adjusting the architecture, or modifying the number of neurons in existing layers.

**3. Feature Extraction or Fine-Tuning:** There are two main approaches to transfer learning:

  - **Feature Extraction:** Freeze the weights of the pre-trained model's layers and add new layers on top to adapt the model for the new task. Only the new layers are trained on the new dataset.

  - **Fine-Tuning:** Unfreeze some of the pre-trained model's layers and allow them to be updated during training along with the new layers.

**4. Train on New Data:** Train the modified model on the new dataset for the target task. The model learns to generalize from the features extracted by the pre-trained layers, or it adapts its features based on both the pre-trained and new layers.

 **Feature extraction and fine-tuning are two common techniques used in transfer learning, a process where a pre-trained neural network model is used as a starting point for training a new model on a different task or dataset. Let's explore the differences between feature extraction and fine-tuning:**

## 1. Feature Extraction:
Feature extraction involves using a pre-trained model's learned features as a fixed set of representations for a new task. In this approach, **you remove the top layers (usually including the fully connected layers responsible for classification) of the pre-trained model and replace them with new layers that are specific to your target task. The pre-trained(CNN Layers) layers are kept frozen during training, meaning their weights are not updated.** Only the newly added layers are trained on the new dataset.

`Key points about feature extraction:`

**1. Frozen Layers:** The layers from the pre-trained model are not updated during training. They are treated as fixed feature extractors.

**2. New Layers:** New layers are added on top of the pre-trained layers to adapt the model to the new task.

**3. Training:** Only the new layers are trained using the new dataset.

**4. Use Case:** Feature extraction is useful when you have a relatively small dataset for your target task and you want to leverage the knowledge captured by the pre-trained model's lower layers.


## 2. Fine-Tuning:
Fine-tuning is a more aggressive approach compared to feature extraction. **It involves not only adding new layers on top of the pre-trained model(CNN Layers) but also unfreezing some of the layers in the pre-trained model and allowing them to be updated with the new dataset. Fine-tuning can help the model adapt more closely to the specific nuances of the new dataset.**

`Key points about fine-tuning:`

**1. Frozen and Unfrozen Layers:** Some of the pre-trained layers are frozen (usually the earlier layers that capture general features), while others are unfrozen and allowed to be updated during training.

**2. New Layers:** New layers are added on top of the pre-trained layers to tailor the model to the new task.

**3. Training:** Both the new layers and some of the pre-trained layers are trained using the new dataset.

**4. Use Case:** Fine-tuning is beneficial when you have a larger dataset and you want the model to adapt more significantly to the new task. However, it requires careful tuning to prevent overfitting.


**Note: In summary, feature extraction involves using pre-trained layers as fixed feature extractors and training only the new layers, while fine-tuning involves updating some of the pre-trained layers in addition to training new layers. The choice between these two techniques depends on factors such as the size of your dataset, the similarity between the source and target tasks, and the computational resources available.**
